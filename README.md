For example the script `mled-cputemp` will make it respond to your CPU's temperature.

I think [this is my notifier](http://www.andmarios.com/links/mail-usb-notifier) but I can't be sure as I bought it a couple of years ago from eBay.

This code (files `main.c` and `Makefile`) is a fork of the ledcontroller code by jmrobles (<http://robleshermoso.wordpress.com>).

My contribution to this code is very small and probably I could never write this on my own.
I added support for all the 7 colors of the notifier as the original code only supported the
3 basic colors. Also I hopefully fixed an issue with a warning output at the kernel's log.
